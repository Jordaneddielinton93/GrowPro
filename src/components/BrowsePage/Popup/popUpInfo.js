      paragraph:"Cherry tomatoes range in size from a thumbtip to the size of a golf ball. Their shape ranges from spherical to slightly oblong to pointed at the bottom. They are often red, but can also be yellow, green, striped, and even black. More oblong cherry tomatoes often share characteristics with plum tomatoes, and are known as grape tomatoes. Cherry tomatoes can be quite sweet (such as the Sungold or Sunsweet yellow varieties), more traditionally acidic, or deep in flavor. They are delicious for snacking, in salads, lightly roasted or grilled, or baked. They require little to no pruning unlike larger tomato plants.",

        "Tomatoes are easy to grow from seed sown indoors in warm conditions. Sow from late March to early April if you plan to grow the plants outdoors. If you’ll be growing your tomatoes in a greenhouse, you can start sowing earlier, from late February to mid-March.",

        "Sow in small pots filled with seed compost, then either place in a propagator or cover each pot with a clear plastic bag and place on a bright windowsill. The young seedlings need to be kept at around 18°C (64°F). Transplant into 9cm (3½in) pots when two true leaves have formed.",

        "Young plants are available from garden centres in spring if you don’t have the space or time to grow from seed. But they will still require frost-free conditions and hardening off before planting outside."
